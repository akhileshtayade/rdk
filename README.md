# Random Dot Kinematogram
This code was used to introduce students(registered in the course, Decision making and the brain at IIT Kanpur(Spring Semester, 2021)) to the Random Dot Kinematogram(RDK).

Please follow to the following steps to visualise the RDK:
1. Download the latest version of [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/) into a directory(check the right side of the page, under 'Releases.')
2. If the downloaded *jsPsych-#.#.#* is a zip folder, extract the folder.
3. Now download the file 'rdk.html' into the same directory where the extracted jsPscyh-#.#.# folder is.
4. Open **rdk.html** in the browser, and manually, switch the browser to the fullscreen mode.
5. If everything went well, you should be able to see a blue tick at the centre of the screen.
6. Press any key on the keyboard to view the RDK. Blue colored dots moving inside a elliptical region would pop up! 

If you want to change the properties of the RDK, please visit https://www.jspsych.org/plugins/jspsych-rdk/ and refer to the parameters mentioned in detail. If yoy wish to add more stimuli to this small demonstration using jsPsych library, please visit to https://www.jspsych.org/.
